# Human-Development
Map of Human Development - A Data Visualization Project

## Background
The Human Development Index (HDI), published by United Nations Development Program, is a summary measure of average achievement in three key dimensions of a country's human development. The three key variables that go into a country's human development score include: Logn and Healthy Life, Knowledge, and A decent standard of living.

## Functionality & MVP
With this data visualization, users will be able to:
* View a map of the world that indicates each country's human development score
* Hover over a country to view breakdown of the country's human development score
* Compare data between years, using a slider

## Wireframes
This single page app is a data visualization of a map and graph of countries around the globe.
